# H1 Rice University Mini-project Pong

# H2 Overview
In this project, we will build a version of Pong, one of the first arcade video games (1972). While Pong is not particularly exciting compared to today's video games, Pong is relatively simple to build and provides a nice opportunity to work on the skills that you will need to build a game like Asteroids. As usual, we have provided a [program template](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#examples-pong_template.py) that can be used to guide your development of Pong.

# H2 CodeSkulptor
This project was designed to run in CodeSkulptor https://py2.codeskulptor.org/

CodeSkulptor is used in two specializations that currently run on Coursera, "Fundamentals of Computing" and "An Introduction to Scripting in Python" . The courses in these specializations were created by Scott Rixner, Joe Warren, Luay Nakhleh, John Greiner, and Stephen Wong. It is also used in Computer Science courses at Rice University.

CodeSkulptor is freely available for all to use in order to help advance computer science education. It is in use across the world in both secondary and university education. We encourage you to make use of CodeSkulptor for education in any way you find valuable!
